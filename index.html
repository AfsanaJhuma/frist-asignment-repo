                <p>We are working with vetted partner NGOs in the region to provide immediate assistance through food
                    packages containing essentials such as rice, lentils, other nonperishable foods, soap, water
                    purification tablets, candles and much more. Your support will help families cope in their time of

                <p>Three major types of flood shelter were identified for the comparison, which are community
                    shelter,school-cum-shelter, and individual homestead. The range of issues included
                    accessibility to shelters, land availability, protection of lives and livelihoods, basic facilities
                    andservices, safety and security of women and children, willingness and priority of potential users,
                    and maintenance and cost-effectiveness</p>

                <h3>Education for a Family</h3>
                <p>Floods brings annual disaster for the people of Shylet by destroying lives and property of the common
                    people. Government machinery and NGOs get busy with the relief and recovery to restore the basic
                    needs of food, clothing and shelter for the people but very less importance is given to the
                    restoration of the education.</p>
